"""
Dictionary is a built-in data type in Python that stores key-value pairs.
Each key is unique and is used to access its corresponding value. Dictionaries are mutable, meaning you can add, remove, or modify key-value pairs after the dictionary has been created. They are commonly used for storing and retrieving data efficiently based on keys.
